first of all the all game is all about RAM (random access memory) 
RAM is all about giving random access of memory 



and OS brings the concept of stack and heap 


then i arised a question like stack is faster than heap if RAM is same then?

 stack is faster because allocation/deallocation is just pointer arithmetic and memory is contiguous, while heap requires searching, bookkeeping, and may suffer cache misses.
